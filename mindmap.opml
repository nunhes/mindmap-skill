    <outline text="Claude Skills" _note="A framework for extending Claude's capabilities through specialized instructions and tools">
      <outline text="Concept" _note="What a Claude Skill is and why it matters.">
        <outline text="Specialized instructions" _note="Break down the task into ordered steps, list fallback options, and specify clarifying questions Claude must ask to stay aligned with the requester"/>
        <outline text="Best practices" _note="Summarize field-tested patterns, tone guidelines, formatting rules, and validation checks that keep the output polished"/>
        <outline text="Tool integration" _note="Detail which Python modules, shell commands, or external APIs are allowed, including invocation syntax and safety constraints"/>
      </outline>
      <outline text="Structure" _note="What's inside a Claude Skill folder.">
        <outline text="SKILL.md" _note="Frontmatter enumerates metadata, inputs, outputs, and allowed tooling. Narrative sections then define objectives, context-gathering prompts, the execution flow, review checklists, and escalation rules so Claude knows precisely how to deliver the task."/>
        <outline text="Supporting files" _note="Stores every asset referenced by SKILL.md—sample inputs, prompt fragments, lookup tables, helper scripts—and keeps them in predictable paths so Claude can load them directly from /mnt/skills."/>
        <outline text="LICENSE.txt" _note="Spells out redistribution rights, attribution wording, data-handling rules, and any limits on commercial or external sharing of the skill bundle."/>
      </outline>
      <outline text="Creation Process" _note="How to craft and package a new skill.">
        <outline text="Identify task" _note="Select a repeatable workflow where expert judgment, brand voice, or compliance rules demand consistent handling from Claude"/>
        <outline text="Test approaches" _note="Experiment with prompts, tool calls, and datasets—logging successes and failures—until you settle on instructions that deliver reliable results"/>
        <outline text="Document patterns" _note="Capture the refined steps, decision points, acceptance criteria, and edge cases so the process survives handoffs and audits"/>
        <outline text="Package resources" _note="Assemble SKILL.md, required assets, and metadata into the folder, running a dry run to ensure Claude can access everything without manual fixes"/>
      </outline>
      <outline text="Usage" _note="How Claude loads and follows a skill.">
        <outline text="Automatic loading" _note="Once mounted, skill folders appear under /mnt/skills, letting Claude read instructions and fetch referenced assets on demand"/>
        <outline text="Claude reads first" _note="Claude reviews SKILL.md before responding, absorbing objectives, guardrails, and escalation guidance so replies stay within scope"/>
        <outline text="Apply knowledge" _note="Throughout the chat, Claude cites the documented flow, runs only approved tools, and cross-checks outputs against the embedded quality checklist"/>
      </outline>
      <outline text="Types" _note="The kinds of skills available to Claude.">
        <outline text="Public" _note="Anthropic-maintained skills that ship with Claude—for example, document conversion or spreadsheet assistants that everyone can access by default"/>
        <outline text="Example" _note="Reference projects published by Anthropic to demonstrate patterns; you can study or customize them to accelerate your own builds"/>
        <outline text="User" _note="Private or team-specific skills you author, embedding proprietary workflows, data policies, or integrations unique to your organization"/>
      </outline>
      <outline text="Benefits" _note="Why teams codify workflows into skills.">
        <outline text="Consistent quality" _note="Codify tone, structure, and acceptance criteria so every run mirrors expert output without constant supervision"/>
        <outline text="Time savings" _note="Reduce prompt tinkering and onboarding effort by giving Claude the winning playbook upfront"/>
        <outline text="Complex tasks" _note="Enable Claude to manage multi-stage projects—research, drafting, QA—while preserving context and guardrails"/>
      </outline>
      <outline text="Resources" _note="Where to find docs, support, and peers.">
        <outline text="Claude Documentation" _note="Offers deep-dive tutorials, launch checklists, and example repositories straight from Anthropic's documentation hub"/>
        <outline text="Support Center" _note="Provides troubleshooting workflows, known-issue trackers, and contact channels for production help"/>
        <outline text="API Reference" _note="Details REST endpoints and payloads for uploading, listing, and enabling skills programmatically"/>
        <outline text="Community" _note="Connects builders through forums and events where they swap skill blueprints and real-world performance notes"/>
